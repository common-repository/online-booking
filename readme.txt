Welcome to the official WordPress [CozyCal Scheduling](https://www.cozycal.com/?utm_source=wordpress) plugin. We are Chris and Kat, the creators of CozyCal. 👋

We started CozyCal with the vision of creating the most elegant and user-friendly scheduling web-app that helps small businesses to grow and thrive. As a two-person team, we understand that small teams need to be nimble and efficient. That’s why we have built a simple but functional scheduling tool that smoothly integrates with your business and takes care of scheduling for you and your team. 🤝

With CozyCal, you can create seamless, customized scheduling experience on your website. CozyCal will increase lead generation, boost conversion, and allow your clients to schedule events easily and quickly right on your website. 

It takes less than 5 minutes to set up your CozyCal account and create a customized scheduling process for your business: 
- **Calendar sync**: Sync with Google calendar and Outlook calendar to keep availabilities up to date.
- **Easy website integration**: Embed a customizable call-to-action button directly on your website, or add the booking page URL to your own preferred button or text for simple scheduling. 
- **Flexible time setting**: Control your availabilities by setting flexible event duration (minutes, hours or days), event booking window, event padding time, or block off specific times.
- **Personalized booking page URL**: Customize and share your booking page or event type URL in emails or on social media for quick and easy scheduling.
- **Event request**: Manually accept or decline event requests to take full control of your schedule.
- **Customize email reminders**: Customize and send automatic email reminders to your clients for scheduled appointments.
- **Flexible intake forms**: Customize intake form questions to collect key client information upon bookings.
- **Manage clients**: Search client contacts and track appointment booking history to identify scheduling patterns.
- **Team scheduling**: Multiple members can be invited to join team booking pages and guests can select preferred team member or auto-assigned member for event scheduling.
- **Automatic timezone handling**: If your client is in a different timezone than you, CozyCal will display the corresponding timezone options for your clients.
- **Mobile friendly interface**: CozyCal’s mobile-friendly interface is designed for your clients to book appointments from anywhere at anytime.

You can also use these integrations to power up your scheduling process: 
- **Stripe Payment integration**: Connect with your Stripe account to receive payments from your clients upon event bookings. We are a [Stripe Verified Partner](https://stripe.com/accept-payments/cozycal-scheduling).
- **Zoom integration**: Zoom video conference details will be automatically generated for every scheduled event for easy online meetings.
- **Zapier integration**: Connect CozyCal with over 500 apps and automate repetitive or tedious tasks in your workflows.
- **Google Hangouts integration**: Automatically generate Google Hangouts meeting links upon guest bookings for easy online meet-ups with your guests.
